Neural Transition-Based Dependency Parsing (44 points)  \n","In this section, you’ll be implementing a neural-network based dependency parser with the goal of maximizing performance on the UAS (Unlabeled Attachment Score) metric.  \n","\n","Before you begin, please follow the README to install all the needed dependencies for the assignment. We will be using PyTorch 1.7.1 from <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/> with the `CUDA` option set to `None`, and the tqdm package – which produces progress bar visualizations throughout your training process. The official PyTorch website is a great resource that includes tutorials for understanding PyTorch’s Tensor library and neural networks.  \n","\n","A dependency parser analyzes the grammatical structure of a sentence, establishing relationships between *head* words, and words which modify those heads. There are multiple types of dependency parsers, including transition-based parsers, graph-based parsers, and feature-based parsers. Your implementation will be a transition-based parser, which incrementally builds up a parse one step at a time. At every step it maintains a *partial* parse, which is represented as follows:  \n","- A *stack* of words that are currently being processed.\n","- A *buffer* of words yet to be processed.\n","- A list of *dependencies* predicted by the parser.  \n","\n","Initially, the stack only contains ROOT, the dependencies list is empty, and the buffer contains all words of the sentence in order. At each step, the parser applies a *transition* to the partial parse until its buffer is empty and the stack size is 1. The following transitions can be applied:  \n","- `SHIFT`: removes the first word from the buffer and pushes it onto the stack  \n","- `LEFT-ARC`: marks the second (second most recently added) item on the stack as a dependent of the first item and removes the second item from the stack, adding a *first_word* → *second_word* dependency to the dependency list.\n","- `RIGHT-ARC`: marks the first (most recently added) item on the stack as a dependent of the second item and removes the first item from the stack, adding a *second_word* → *first_word* dependency to the dependency list.  \n","  \n","On each step, your parser will decide among the three transitions using a neural network classifier.  \n","- (a) (4 points) Go through the sequence of transitions needed for parsing the sentence _\"I parsed this sentence correctly\"_.
