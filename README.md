## CS224n Assignment Soultions Winter 2021
Following the course of Stanford [CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/index.html), this repository is for my solutions for the assignments of the course.  

### Assignment 1: Introduction to word vectors  
- [1. Exploring Word Vectors](https://github.com/12kdh43/cs224n/blob/master/a1/exploring_word_vectors.ipynb)
### Assignment 2: Derivatives and implementation of word2vec algorithm
- [1. Written: Understanding word2vec](https://github.com/12kdh43/cs224n/blob/master/a2/a2_written.ipynb)  
- 2. Coding: Implementing word2vec - [word2vec.py](https://github.com/12kdh43/cs224n/blob/master/a2/word2vec.py) / [sgd.py](https://github.com/12kdh43/cs224n/blob/master/a2/sgd.py)  
### Assignment 3: Dependency parsing and neural network foundations
### Assignment 4: Neural Machine Translation with sequence-to-sequence, attention, and subwords
### Assignment 5: Self-supervised learning and fine-tuning with Transformers
### Lab  
- [Week 1: Gensim word vector visualization of various word vectors](https://github.com/12kdh43/cs224n/blob/master/lab/Gensim_word_vector_visualization.ipynb)
